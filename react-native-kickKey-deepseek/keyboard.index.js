/**
 * Fabric mount-pipeline pump — THE fix for the "jsReady=true children=0" black keyboard.
 *
 * Verified against the RN 0.86.2 sources in node_modules:
 *  - Every C++ mount transaction produced by a React commit is queued by
 *    `RuntimeScheduler_Modern::scheduleRenderingUpdate()` into
 *    `pendingRenderingUpdates_` (RuntimeScheduler_Modern.cpp).
 *  - That queue is drained ONLY inside `RuntimeScheduler_Modern::updateRendering()`,
 *    which runs exclusively at the END of a JS event-loop task (executeEventLoopTask).
 *  - A normal app's JS keeps scheduling work (timers, rAF, animations, ...), so the
 *    mount transaction is flushed on the next task and `FabricMountingManager::
 *    executeMount()` → `FabricUIManager.scheduleMountItem()` delivers the items to Java.
 *  - The keyboard bundle is STATIC: after the initial runApplication + commit there is
 *    nothing left on the JS event loop, so the mount transaction is never executed and
 *    the ReactSurfaceView keeps 0 children forever — while JS (jsReady=true), the
 *    ReactHost lifecycle (RESUMED), the ReactContext (RESUMED) and the Choreographer
 *    frame pump (framePump=alive) are all perfectly healthy.
 *
 * This interval is a no-op callback that keeps ONE event-loop task in flight at all
 * times. Every tick ends with `updateRendering()`, which drains any pending mount
 * transactions and delivers them to Java, where the (jsReady-gated) resumed
 * DispatchUIFrameCallback applies them to the surface view. 33ms ≈ 30fps is plenty for
 * a keyboard, and the same mechanism guarantees every LATER commit (key presses, layout
 * switches, suggestions) is flushed promptly instead of silently stalling again.

// ── Early mount-pipeline pump ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Start the pump at MODULE LOAD time (before React renders) so the very first

// for a useEffect to register the interval after React mount.
